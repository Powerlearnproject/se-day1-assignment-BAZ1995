# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The process of designing, developing, and maintaining software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1,Development of programing languages like fortan
2, Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 60s
3,Advent of structured programing in the 70s to name but a few

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - collecting and documenting needs of users
Design- creating designs and structure for software
Implementation-writing code and building software
Testing- checking if software meets standards
RElease- giving custoomers access to the software
Maintanannce- checking to update software and making it safe

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfal is a sequential approach to software development whereas agile is an iterative and incremaental approach to software development
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer writes and implements code
Quality assusrance engineer ensures quality by designing and implementing tests on software
Project manager oversees planning execution and delivery of projects in regards to software

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES provide suites that are comprehensive for debuging , testing and writting code such as Visual studio whereas VCS tracks changes in code among teams such as Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges  includeChanging requirements, tight deadlines, Technical debt , they can be overcome by factoring scalability and reasesement of goals

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing is testing of individual modules
Integrated testing is testing of the interactions between different components

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the crafting of proper to questions to ai and thus in turn getting more clear responses
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is tell me about vehicles, this generalises about all motor vehicles but when i prompt ai such as tell me more about sports cars like Porsche it then goes in deep giving more great responses
